JAX-DNA is a Python package for simulating and fitting coarse-grained molecular
models to macroscopic experimental data.

Currently, JAX-DNA can run simulations using
[JAX-MD](https://github.com/jax-md/jax-md) and [oxDNA](https://oxdna.org/)
(You must install oxDNA yourself however).

Further, JAX-DNA supports the fitting models using JAX-MD (Direct Differentiation,
and [DiffTRe](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27241-4)) and oxDNA
(DiffTRe only).


## Quick Start

We recommend using a fresh conda environment with Python 3.11. You can create a
new environment with the following command:

```bash
conda create -y -n jax-dna python=3.11
conda activate jax-dna
```

Depending on your hardware, you may want to install the GPU accelerated version
of JAX, see the [JAX
documentation](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html#installation)
for more details on how to do this. If you aren't interested in GPU support, you
can skip straight to installing JAX-DNA which will install the CPU version of
JAX.


First install JAX-DNA using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.cpom/rkruegs123/jax-dna.git
```

### Simulations

Information on how to run a simulation can be found in the
[documentation](https://jax-dna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#running-a-single-simulation).

One advantage of JAX-DNA is that you can specify a custom energy function for
both simulations and optimizations. Information on how energy functions are
defined and how to define your own energy functions can be found in the
documentation.

### Optimizations

Optimizations can be thought of in two kinds: simple and advanced.


#### Simple Optimizations

Simple optimizations are those optimizations where a set of parameters are fit
with respect to a single objective as a function of a single simulation. This is
usually a helpful introduction to how JAX-DNA works. Documentation on how simple
optimizations work can be found
[here](https://jax-dna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#running-a-simple-optimization)
in the documentation.

To see examples of simple simulations, go to
[examples](https://github.com/rkruegs123/jax-dna/tree/master/examples/simulations),
where you can find both JAX-MD and oxDNA examples.

### Advanced Optimizations

Advanced optimizations are those optimizations where a set of parameters are
fit with respect to more than one objective and as a function of multiple possibly
heterogeneous simulations. These kinds of optimizations are covered in the
documentation [here](https://jax-dna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced_usage.html#advanced-optimizations).
